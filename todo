    - scheduled shutdowns should be avoided if they were
	scheduled while on battery and the unit has been plugged
	in while sleeping.  a) enable AC wakeup events during
	that sleep, and change what's scheduled to happen based
	on those events.  or b), more simply, check for AC when
	we awake for shutdown, and if we have AC (rather, if $savepower
	isn't set), then go back to sleep for the same amount of time.
	repeat adinfinitum.  this has the drawback that if you only
	plug in briefly, and happen to hit the wakeup event, then
	you won't shut down the way you otherwise would have.  but
	it's probably good enough.

    - if the battery goes low while we're sleeping, we won't shut down --
	we'll just crash.  i'm reluctant to enable the 1% battery
	SOC wakeup, because that seems like a lot of wakeups. 
	too bad there's no "wake me at this batter threshold"
	wakeup.  if we created one in the EC -- reuse the battery_error
	event, and have it occur when we cross the 5% threshold, for
	instance -- we could use that to waken and shut down.  (we
	should fix the /sys/class/power_supply/olpc-battery/capacity_level
	output as well, but that's in the kernel.  currently it never
	hits "critical".)

	if wakeup happened at 10%, then we could beep (configurable)
	every 1% thereafter until we hit shutdown.

    - should give a beep warning before critical battery shutdown.

    - add monitoring of cpu and/or network load to prevent sleeps
	when "busy" with other than user input

    - is there a dbus "i'm busy" indicator we could/should be
	looking at as well?

    - how should mesh and AP connections be treated wrt keeping the
	wireless alive?  if we sleep with an AP connection, will we
	eventually lose association anyway?

    - USB keyboards and mice:  need a way to get user activity/idle
	from them.  unfortunately, the "right" way to do this would
	mean adding support for USB devices to olpc-kbdshim, which
	would complicate it quite a bit (needing to monitor plug/unplug
	etc).  i'd rather keep that daemon very simple.  perhaps
	another daemon that just does USB?  perhaps there's a way
	to use dbus to optionally get activity reports when USB
	devices are in use?

    - powerd-configure has no means of creating a new profile -- just
	editing existing ones.  (all that's needed is an existing file --
	current contents is optional.)

    - cahalan asked whether the geode's video stream is ever turned off.
	can it be?

    - likewise for the lcd panel.  can it be turned off?
