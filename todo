    - currently i enable the 1% battery SOC wakeup when the battery is
	getting low, and check the voltage against critical (5.7V) then.
	but that's only possible if we're awake to
	notice.  i'm reluctant to enable the 1% battery SOC
	wakeup all the time, because that seems like a lot of
	wakeups.  too bad there's no "wake me at this battery
	threshold" wakeup -- preferably for voltage, which is what
	really matters.  (we should fix the
	/sys/class/power_supply/olpc-battery/capacity_level
	output as well, but that's in the kernel.  currently it
	never hits "critical".)

	[ later:  it seems the EC generates a critical battery
	SCI.  the kernel just needs to start watching for it. ]

	if wakeup happened a bit early then we could beep
	(configurable) every so often thereafter until we hit shutdown
	or the condition cleared.

    - there's no way to specify no dimming for just one of the
	modes.  i.e., i'd like dimming when on battery in laptop
	mode, but not in ebook mode (where i want it to sleep
	right away, but at full brightness).  this would mean
	a per-mode dimlevel.

	better to create separate configurations, and switch among
	them using "powerd-config <profilename>", which will
	swap in a different config and signal powerd to reconfigure.
	this lets one manage different configs for different
	uses.  the way the laptop is used on vacation might be
	different than at school, or than at the beach, etc.)

    - add monitoring of network load (how?) to prevent sleeps?

    - someone should write an ohmd "keystore" to powerd
	"inhibit-file" translator to convert the get/set that
	some activities and processes do in order to inhibit
	suspend into something powerd can use.  or else, augment
	the activities to use the new api as well as, or in place
	of, the old.

    - how should mesh and AP connections be treated wrt keeping the
	wireless alive?  if we sleep with an AP connection, will we
	eventually lose association anyway?


debxo:
    - rtcwake doesn't work -- kernel config?

      /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/device/power/wakeup: No such file or directory
      rtcwake: /dev/rtc0 not enabled for wakeup events
