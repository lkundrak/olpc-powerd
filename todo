    - scheduled shutdowns should be avoided if they were
	scheduled while on battery and the unit has been plugged
	in while sleeping.  this should be done by enabling AC
	wakeup events during that sleep, and changing what's
	scheduled to happen based on those events.  (imagine the
	laptop being plugged in, and then unplugged.  if we only
	check state when the shutdown wakeup happens, and we
	happen to be plugged in when it does, we'll perhaps sleep
	forever.  need to do something sensible.) (i'm reluctant
	to enable the 1% battery SOC wakeup, because that seems
	like a lot of wakeups, but maybe.  (probably only enable when
	discharging, in order to allow for critical level shutdown.)
	(it's still about 100 wakeups -- to bad there's no "wake
	me at this batter threshold" wakeup.)

    - add monitoring of cpu and/or network load to prevent sleeps
	when "busy" with other than user input

    - is there a dbus "i'm busy" indicator we could/should be
	looking at as well?

    - how should mesh and AP connections be treated wrt keeping the
	wireless alive?  if we sleep with an AP connection, will we
	eventually lose association anyway?

    - USB keyboards and mice:  need a way to get user activity/idle
	from them.  unfortunately, the "right" way to do this would
	mean adding support for USB devices to olpc-kbdshim, which
	would complicate it quite a bit (needing to monitor plug/unplug
	etc).  i'd rather keep that daemon very simple.  perhaps
	another daemon that just does USB?  perhaps there's a way
	to use dbus to optionally get activity reports when USB
	devices are in use?

    - powerd-configure has no means of creating a new profile -- just
	editing existing ones.  (all that's needed is an existing file --
	current contents is optional.)

    - cahalan asked whether the geode's video stream is ever turned off.
	can it be?

    - likewise for the lcd panel.  can it be turned off?
