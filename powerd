#
# powerd -- experimental power management for the XO
#
# This daemon is a more transparent and flexible (if somewhat
# incompatible) replacement for ohmd on the XO.  powerd is
# independent of X, dbus, and hald, and so might be attractive to
# very lightweight software distributions.
#
# In addition to "standard" XO/ohmd functionality, powerd adds:
# -- a power button splash screen (allowing cancel, suspend, or shutdown).
# -- the ability to run arbitrary scripts after a resume.
# -- configurable timeouts until screen dim and sleep, and configurable
#    dim level.
# -- screen dimming and blanking after laptop has slept
# -- shutdown after laptop has slept
# -- low battery shutdown (only when not sleeping)
# -- different power management behavior when on wall power vs. battery.
# -- different behavior when in ebook mode
# -- ease of customization, given that its written in shell.
#
# Unimplemented:
# -- inhibiting idle suspend based on network load.
# -- probably more.
#
#####
#
# Configuration:
#
# Major config variables are documented below.  powerd reads
# its configuration from /etc/powerd/powerd.conf once at startup,
# and again only when it receives a "reconfig" event on its
# event fifo (/var/run/powerevents).
#
# If /etc/powerd/powerd.conf is a symlink to another file, then
# powerd-config can be used to easily manage a set of
# named configuration "profiles".  So different configurations
# can be used at different times of day, or during different
# tasks, etc.
#
# All times are expressed in seconds (though a UI could do
# whatever it wants, of course).  Booleans can be enabled with
# "yes", "Yes", "true", "True", or "1".  Anything else will turn
# them off.
#
# There are "dim", "sleep", and "blank" timers for each of
# "plugged in", "battery", and "ebook" modes.  (If the laptop is
# plugged in while in ebook mode, the plugged in timers are
# used.) The nine idle timers are:
#
#   config_BATTERY_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#   config_EBOOK_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#   config_PLUGGED_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#
# Dimming, blanking, and sleep can be scheduled in any order.  If
# "sleep" happens first, the screen will stay on (potentially
# dimmed) while the rest of the system sleeps, but any keystroke
# or touchpad activity will awaken it.  If "sleep" is scheduled
# after "dim" or "blank", the screen will go dim and/or dark
# while the laptop remains otherwise fully active.  Obviously,
# scheduling dimming after blanking only serves to skip the
# dimming state, since a blanked screen can't be dimmed.
#
# Setting any of the timers to '0' suppresses that action.  (The
# value is converted to 999999999 seconds internally, so you may
# see that in the logs.
#
# In any case, when the screen is dark _and_ the laptop is
# sleeping, it's in a "deep" sleep -- keystrokes will not wake it
# up, just as if the power button had been used.  The maximum
# time that this state (screen off, cpu sleeping) will last
# before the laptop shuts down is given by
# "config_MAX_SLEEP_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN".  (This is arguably
# mis-named, since it's not really "max sleep time before
# shutdown", but "max asleep-and-blank time before shutdown".)
# Again, a setting of '0' will be internally converted to 999999999.
#
# Turning off "config_ALLOW_SHUTDOWN_WHEN_PLUGGED" will keep the
# laptop from ever completely shutting down when it has external
# power.  It may still shut down when using battery power.
#
# "config_IDLE_DIM_LEVEL" specifies how far the screen will dim
# when the ("config_..._TIME_DIM") timer fires.  The range is
# 0-15.  If set to 15, the screen will never dim.
#
# "config_CONFIRM_SECONDS" determines how long the shutdown/suspend
# confirmation splash screen stays visible before the laptop
# automatically suspends.  If this is set to zero, there will be
# no splash screen:  the laptop will suspend immediately on a
# power button push.  In this case, shutdown must be done via
# a menu entry, or other command.
#
# "config_UNFREEZE_SECONDS" specifies the delay before powerd
# will unfreeze the DCON, after starting up.
#
# "config_MESH_DURING_SUSPEND" (boolean) controls whether the
# wireless remains powered while the laptop is fully suspended
# (i.e.  sleeping with a dark screen).  The only reason to set
# this to "yes" is if you want the laptop to forward packets for
# other mesh users while you're not using it.
#
# "config_WAKE_ON_WLAN" -- controls whether a packet destined for
# your laptop will wake it up from idle suspend, in much the same
# way that a keystroke or mouse movement will wake it up.
#
# "config_CPU_IDLE_LIMIT" (integer)  If the cpu is idle less than
# this percentage, then the laptop won't suspend, on the
# assumption that the system is doing something "important" for the
# user.  Set this to 0 to to allow the system to sleep no matter
# how busy the CPU.
#
# "config_SLEEP_WHEN_LID_CLOSED" causes the laptop to go to sleep
# when closed, and is usually desirable.  Cases where one might
# want to turn this off might be a laptop being used as a server
# on a shelf, or perhaps when running an application which needs
# to remain active while the laptop is transported.  The screen
# will be turned off in any case, of course.
#
# powerd can optionally perform detailed power usage logging.
# powerd must be restarted for any changes to the following
# config_PWRLOG_XXX... settings to take effect:
#
# "config_PWRLOG_INTERVAL" determines whether, and how often,
# logging will be performed.  A value of less than 30 seconds
# will disable power logging.  Anything else gives the
# approximate maximum interval between logged samples.  10
# minutes (i.e., a value of 600) is a useful setting.  (The value
# is approximate, because the actual logging depends on the
# granularity of the timer events received from olpc-switchd.)
#
# "config_PWRLOG_DIR" is the final destination for the power logs.
# Logs are initially written to /var/log, and copied every 30 minutes
# to the final directory.
#
# "config_PWRLOG_LOGSIZE" is the maximum size, in Kbytes, of any single
# log file.  When a log file crosses this threshold, it will be
# remove (after copying to $config_PWRLOG_DIR) and a new log
# started.
#
# "config_PWRLOG_LOGDIRSIZE" is the maximum total size of
# $config_PWRLOG_DIR.  When the directory grows too large, the
# oldest files are removed until the size is below this threshold.
#
#
######
#
# Inhibiting sleep
#
# Idle dim/blank/sleep can be inhibited externally by two separate
# means:
#
# 1) A file may be created in
#     /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/
#   The file must be named after the PID of the process doing the
#   inhibiting (and may be empty).  Stale inhibit files (i.e.,
#   their owner pid doesn't exist) will be removed when the next
#   dim is attempted.  To manually inhibit dim/blank/sleep one can
#   simply create a file named after a long-running process:  e.g.,
#   "touch /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/1".  (Such a file will
#   need to be manually removed, of course.)  To assist with the
#   common case of inhibiting suspend while a given program is
#   running, the "olpc-nosleep" wrapper is provided.  e.g.:
#       $ olpc-nosleep wget http://veryslow.downloads.com/bigfile
#
#   The above pid-based flags aren't persistent.  To inhibit
#   suspend in a persistent way (i.e., across reboots), create the
#   file:
#     /etc/powerd/flags/inhibit-suspend
#
# 2) The modification time of the file
#     /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/.fake_activity
#   will be checked before any dim/blank/sleep occurs, and will be
#   compared to the time of the last "real" user activity.  If it
#   is newer, the dim/blank/sleep will be skipped.  So a program
#   wishing to indicate that it is "active" can simply touch this
#   file periodically to keep it up-to-date.  As a convenience, the
#   command:
#     powerd-config -a
#   will do this touch.  For example, to keep the laptop alive while
#   an ssh session is in use, add:
#     export PROMPT_COMMAND='powerd-config -a'
#   to your .bash_profile.  This will cause the file to be touched
#   at ever shell prompt.
#
# Post-resume scripts can be put in /etc/powerd/postresume.d -- the
# scripts will be run in lexicographic order.  The scripts are run
# detached from powerd, so they won't impede its operation -- however,
# they should be kept as short as possible.
#
#
######
#
# Background discussion:
#
# The inputs that contribute to power management are:
#
# - Switches:
#       power button
#       ebook
#       lid
#   Actions on these switches appear as input events on
#   /dev/input/event[012].  Powerd relies on the companion program
#   "olpc-switchd" to report these events via the /var/run/powerevents
#   fifo it creates for the purpose.  It's unfortunate that these
#   events have no corresponding /sys state indicators, since
#   knowing the state of the lid (or of ebook mode) would be useful
#   in the absence of events (at startup, for instance).
#
#
# - Conditions:
#       AC input (boolean)
#       battery capacity (numeric)
#   It's unfortunate that these have no easily accessible
#   corresponding events (they're available via uevents, sigh).
#   Because they don't, olpc-switchd also monitors these two status
#   nodes (under /sys) and synthesizes events to represent their
#   transitions.  (olpc-switchd will use the AC power jack input
#   device (input3) if it's available, and will poll just the
#   battery in that case.)
#
# - Wakeups:
#       rtc wakeup
#       ac_power
#       battery_error
#       battery_soc (i.e. "state of charge" --> capacity)
#       battery_state
#       ebook_mode_change
#       ps2event
#       wlan
#       lid (or sometimes "empty sci")
#   When the system wakes from sleep, /sys/power/wakeup-source reports
#   the cause.  Lid reporting is not reliable -- sometimes "empty sci"
#   is reported instead.  (This can happen either for lid open or close
#   events.)  Note that in older kernels (including the kernel that
#   shipped with build 767) an rtc wakeup will report "empty sci"
#   instead of "rtc alarm".  powerd doesn't support those kernels
#   very well, since "empty sci" can mean either "lid" or "rtc".
#
# - User activity/idleness:
#   powerd expects user activity and user idle events to be delivered via
#   the olpc-kbdshim daemon, when invoked with "-A /var/run/powerevents".
#   The possible events are:
#       useractivity
#       useridle1
#       useridle2
#       useridle3
#
#   These events may be used to dim the screen, blank the screen, and/or
#   put the CPU to sleep, in any order.
#
# - Other system activity: cpu load (implemented), network load
#       (unimplemented), etc.
#
#
######
#
# Implementation notes:
#
# - System transitions
#
#   The system can be configured to go through the following 6
#   transition sequences:
#
#       #1      dim     sleep    {blank}  {shutdown}
#       #2      dim     blank    sleep    {shutdown}
#       #3      blank   [dim]    sleep    {shutdown}
#       #4      blank   sleep    {[dim]}  {shutdown}
#       #5      sleep   {blank}  {[dim]}  {shutdown}
#       #6      sleep   {dim}    {blank}  {shutdown}
#
#      {xxx} -- any transition that follows "sleep" is handled in
#           the snooze() function, and not by the useridleN events.
#           That's what the {braces} mean:  "handled by snooze".
#      [dim] -- this state is a no-op, since dimming after blanking
#           doesn't make sense.
#
#   Transitions up through and including "sleep" are driven by the
#   useridle1,2,3 events, and handled by the action routines
#   (dim_action(), blank_action(), and sleep_action()).  These are
#   relatively straightforward.  Once the system is sleeping (using
#   rtcwake), the transitions are handled within the snooze()
#   function.
#
#   As a result of the no-op "[dim]" transition, the
#   implementation of snooze() for sequences #1 and #5 is
#   identical, as is the implementation for #2, #3 and #4.  So
#   snooze() only really has three separate cases to deal with,
#   represented by sequences #2, #1, and #6.  These cases are:
#      - dim then blank then shutdown
#      - blank then shutdown
#      - shutdown
#
#
# - X11
#
#   Note that X11 DPMS is neither consulted nor modified, and it
#   may still blank the display after some period of inactivity.
#   (This won't happen, of course, unless the DPMS "standby" time
#   is shorter than powerd's "sleep" time.)  The effect of DPMS
#   doing this will result in confusion, since when DPMS blanks the
#   screen, powerd can't tell that it's been done.  I.e., a laptop
#   with a screen blanked by DPMS may behave differently than one
#   blanked by powerd.  DPMS should be disabled, either in
#   xorg.conf, or with "xset -dpms".
#
#
# - POSIX shell
#
#   The intention is that powerd be runnable with most any modern
#   shell.  No bash-specific features were used, unless by accident.
#   One possible exception:  in order to implement a non-blocking
#   read of the event fifo, I had to use "read -t 1" (in
#   event_fifo_lookahead()).  Most newer shells implement this, but
#   it's not POSIX.  (The Debian "dash" shell does not, the "ash"
#   shell in busybox works fine.) If run with a shell that doesn't
#   support "-t", the only failure will be the possibility of lost
#   wakeups:  hitting a key just as the system wakes just to dim
#   the screen may not prevent the subsequent sleep.  Another
#   exception is the (optional) inclusion of olpc-pwr-log.sh, which
#   is heavily dependent on non-POSIX features.
