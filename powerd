# powerd -- experimental power management for the XO
# 
# This daemon is a more transparent and flexible (if somewhat
# incompatible) replacement for ohmd on the XO.  powerd is
# independent of X, dbus, and hald, and so might be attractive to
# very lightweight software distributions.
#
# In addition to "standard" XO/ohmd functionality, powerd adds:
# -- a power button splash screen (allowing cancel, suspend, or shutdown).
# -- the ability to run arbitrary scripts after a resume.
# -- configurable timeouts until screen dim and sleep, and configurable
#    dim level.
# -- idle screen blanking after laptop has slept
# -- idle shutdown after laptop has slept
# -- low battery shutdown (only when not sleeping)
# -- different power management behavior when on wall power vs. battery.
# -- different behavior when in ebook mode
# -- ease of customization, given that its written in shell.
#
# Unimplemented:
# -- inhibiting idle suspend based network load.
# -- any special support for the mesh, whatsoever.
# -- there's some support for wake-on-lan, but it's not well tested.
# -- probably more.
#
#####
#
# Configuration:
#
# Major config variables are documented below.  powerd reads
# its configuration from /etc/powerd/powerd.conf once at startup,
# and again only when it receives a "reconfig" event on its
# event fifo (/var/run/powerevents).
#
# All times are expressed in seconds (though a UI could do
# whatever it wants, of course).  Booleans can be enabled with
# "yes", "Yes", "true", "True", or "1".  Anything else will turn
# them off.
#
# There are "dim", "sleep", and "blank" timers for each of
# "plugged in", "battery", and "ebook" modes.  (If the laptop is
# plugged in while in ebook mode, the plugged in timers are
# used.) The nine idle timers are:
#
#   config_BATTERY_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#   config_EBOOK_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#   config_PLUGGED_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#
# Dimming must happen first.  Sleep and blanking can happen in
# either order.  If "sleep" happens first, the screen will stay on
# while the rest of the system sleeps, but any keystroke or
# touchpad activity will awaken it.  If blanking is scheduled
# first, the screen will go dark while the laptop remains
# otherwise fully active.  In either case, when the screen is
# dark and the laptop is sleeping, it's a "deep" sleep --
# keystrokes will not wake it up, just as if the power button had
# been used.  The maximum time that any sleep will last before
# the laptop shuts down is given by "config_MAX_SLEEP_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN".
#
# If it's never desirable for the laptop to completely shut down
# when plugged in, then "config_ALLOW_SHUTDOWN_WHEN_PLUGGED" should
# be turned off.
#
# "config_IDLE_DIM_LEVEL" specifies how dim will the screen go
# when the first ("config_..._TIME_DIM") timer fires.  The range
# is 0-15.  If set to 15, the screen will never dim.
#
# "config_CONFIRM_SECONDS" determines how long the shutdown/suspend
# confirmation splash screen stays visible before the laptop
# automatically suspends.
#
# "config_WAKE_ON_WLAN" (boolean) allows wireless to
# continue operating when the laptop is sleeping.  Note that the
# wireless configuration may allow shutting down the wireless
# entirely (e.g., with "echo 0>/sys/power/wlan-enabled"), which
# may override this setting.
#
# "config_CPU_IDLE_LIMIT" (integer)  If the cpu is idle less than
# this percentage, then the laptop won't suspend, on the
# assumption that the system is doing something "important" for the
# user.
#
# "config_SLEEP_WHEN_LID_CLOSED" causes the laptop to go to sleep
# when closed, and is usually desirable.  Cases where one might
# want to turn this off might be a laptop being used as a server
# on a shelf, or perhaps when running an application which needs
# to remain active while the laptop is transported.  The screen
# will be turned off in any case, of course.
#
# If /etc/powerd.conf is a symlink to another file, then powerd-config
# can be used to easily manage a set of configuration "profiles".
# So different configurations can be used at different times of day,
# or during different tasks, etc.
#
######
#
# Inhibiting sleep
#
# Idle dim/blank/sleep can be inhibited externally by two separate
# means: 
#
# 1) A file may be created in
#     /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/
#   The file must be named after the PID of the process doing the
#   inhibiting (and may be empty).  Stale inhibit files will be
#   removed when the next dim is attempted.  To manually inhibit
#   dim/blank/sleep one can simply create a file named after a
#   long-running process:  e.g., "touch /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/1".
#   Such a file will need to be manually removed, of course.
#
# 2) The modification time of the file
#     /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/.fake_activity
#   will be checked before any dim/blank/sleep occurs, and compared
#   to the time of the last "real" user activity.  If it is newer,
#   the dim/blank/sleep will be avoided.  So a program wishing to
#   indicate that it is "active" can simply touch this file
#   periodically to keep it up-to-date.  The command:
#     powerd-config -a
#   will do this touch.  For example, to keep the laptop alive while
#   an ssh session is in use, add:
#     export PROMPT_COMMAND='powerd-config -a'
#   into your .bash_profile.
# 
# Post-resume scripts can be put in /etc/powerd/postresume.d -- the
# scripts will be run in lexicographic order.  The scripts are run
# detached from powerd, so they won't impede its operation -- however,
# they should be kept as short as possible.
#
#
######
#
# Background discussion:
#
# The inputs that contribute to power management are:
#
# - Switches:
#       power button
#       ebook
#       lid
#   Actions on these switches appear as events on /dev/input/event[012]. 
#   Powerd relies on the companion program "olpc-switchd" to report
#   these events via the /var/run/powerevents fifo it creates for the
#   purpose.  It's unfortunate that these events have no corresponding
#   /sys state indicators, since knowing the state of the lid (or of
#   ebook mode) would be useful in the absence of events (at startup,
#   for instance).
#
#
# - Conditions:
#       AC input (boolean)
#       battery capacity (numeric)
#   It's unfortunate that these have no corresponding events.  Because
#   they don't, olpc-switchd also monitors these two nodes (under /sys)
#   and synthesizes events to represent their transitions.
#
#
# - Wakeups:
#       ac_power
#       battery_error
#       battery_soc (i.e. "state of charge" --> capacity)
#       battery_state
#       ebook_mode_change
#       ps2event
#       wlan
#       lid (or sometimes "empty sci")
#   When the system wakes from sleep, /sys/power/wakeup-source reports
#   the cause.  Lid reporting is not reliable -- sometimes "empty sci"
#   is reported instead.  (I've not yet seen a case where "empty sci" is
#   reported for lid close I'm not ruling it out.)
#
#
# - User activity/idleness:
#   powerd expects user activity and user idle events to be delivered via
#   the olpc-kbdshim daemon, when invoked with "-A /var/run/powerevents".
#   The possible events are:
#       useractivity
#       useridle1
#       useridle2
#       useridle3
#
#   These events are used in the following ways:
#
#                  screen          cpu
#                  ------          ---
#     useridle1     dim            on
#     useridle2     dim            sleep
#     rtcwake1      off            sleep
#     rtcwake2           shutdown
#
#   Or, if $config_TIME_BLANK is less than $config_TIME_SLEEP, then
#   this sequence, which is more like a "normal" laptop behaves:
#
#                  screen          cpu
#                  ------          ---
#     useridle1     dim            on
#     useridle2     off            on
#     useridle3     off            sleep
#     rtcwake2           shutdown
#
#
# - Other system activity: cpu load (implemented), network load
#       (unimplemented), etc.
#
#
# Note that X11 DPMS is neither consulted nor modified, and it
# may still blank the display after some period of inactivity. 
# (This won't happen, of course, unless the DPMS "standby" time
# is shorter than powerd's "config_..._TIME_SLEEP" time.)  The
# effect of DPMS doing this will result in confusion, since when
# DPMS blanks the screen, powerd can't tell that it's been done. 
# I.e., a laptop with a screen blanked by DPMS may behave
# differently than one blanked by powerd.  So "xset -dpms" is
# recommended, preferably in olpc-session.
#
# My intention is that powerd be runnable with most any modern
# shell.  No bash-specific features were used, unless by
# accident.
#
# Please send commends/suggestions/patches to pgf@laptop.org.
