#
# powerd -- power management for the XO
#
# This daemon is a more transparent and flexible (if somewhat
# incompatible) replacement for ohmd on the XO.  powerd is
# independent of X, dbus, and hald, and so might be attractive to
# very lightweight software distributions.
#
# In addition to "standard" XO/ohmd functionality, powerd adds:
# -- a power button splash screen (allowing cancel, suspend, or shutdown).
# -- the ability to run arbitrary scripts after a resume.
# -- configurable timeouts until screen dim and sleep, and configurable
#    dim level.
# -- screen dimming and blanking after laptop has slept
# -- shutdown after laptop has slept
# -- low battery shutdown (only when not sleeping)
# -- different power management behavior when on wall power vs. battery.
# -- different behavior when in ebook mode
# -- ease of customization, given that its written in shell.
# -- integrated power logging, to assist in analyzing XO power usage
#
#
#####
#
# Configuration:
#
# Major config variables are documented below.  powerd reads
# its configuration from /etc/powerd/powerd.conf once at startup,
# and again only when it receives a "reconfig" event on its
# event fifo.  (short answer:  "sudo powerd-config =restart")
#
# If /etc/powerd/powerd.conf is a symlink to another file, then
# powerd-config can be used to easily manage a set of
# named configuration "profiles".  So different configurations
# can be used at different times of day, or during different
# tasks, etc.
#
# All times are expressed in seconds (though a UI could do
# whatever it wants, of course).  Booleans can be enabled with
# "yes", "Yes", "true", "True", or "1".  Anything else will turn
# them off.
#
# There are "dim", "sleep", and "blank" timers for each of
# "plugged in", "battery", and "ebook" modes.  (If the laptop is
# plugged in while in ebook mode, the plugged in timers are
# used.) The nine idle timers are:
#
#   config_BATTERY_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#   config_EBOOK_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#   config_PLUGGED_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
#
# Dimming, blanking, and sleep can be scheduled in any order.  If
# "sleep" happens first, the screen will stay on (potentially
# dimmed) while the rest of the system sleeps, but any keystroke
# or touchpad activity will awaken it.  If "sleep" is scheduled
# after "dim" or "blank", the screen will go dim and/or dark
# while the laptop remains otherwise fully active.  Obviously,
# scheduling dimming after blanking only serves to skip the
# dimming state, since a blanked screen can't be dimmed.
#
# Setting any of the timers to '0' suppresses that action.  (The
# value is converted to 999999999 seconds internally, so you may
# see that in the logs.)
#
# Depending on the setting of # "config_KEYPRESS_WAKE_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP",
# when the screen is dark _and_ the laptop is sleeping, it may or
# may not be in a "deep" sleep -- keystrokes may or may not wake it
# up.  Likewise, "config_WLAN_WAKE_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP" controls
# whether wlan packets may wake the laptop.  (See below for more
# information.)  The maximum time that this state (i.e., screen off, cpu
# sleeping) will last before the laptop shuts down is given by
# "config_MAX_SLEEP_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN".  (This is arguably mis-named,
# since it's not really "max sleep time before shutdown", but "max
# sleeping-and-blank time before shutdown".) Again, a setting of '0'
# will be internally converted to 999999999.
#
# Turning off "config_ALLOW_SHUTDOWN_WHEN_PLUGGED" will keep the
# laptop from ever completely shutting down when it has external
# power.  It may still shut down when using battery power.
#
# "config_INITIAL_BRIGHT_LEVEL" specifies the initial brightness
# setting for the screen.  The range is 0-15.  The scale is
# linear, and the full-on power consumption of the backlight is
# 1W, so each level increases power consumption by about 67mW.
#
# "config_IDLE_DIM_LEVEL" specifies how far the screen will dim
# when the dim timer fires.  The range is 0-15.  If set to 15, the
# screen will never dim.
#
# "config_CONFIRM_SECONDS" determines how long the shutdown/suspend
# confirmation splash screen stays visible before the laptop
# automatically suspends.  If this is set to zero, there will be
# no splash screen, and the laptop will suspend immediately on a
# power button push.  In this case, shutdown must be done via
# a menu entry or other command.
#
# "config_UNFREEZE_SECONDS" specifies the delay before powerd
# will unfreeze the DCON, after starting up.
#
# "config_MESH_DURING_SUSPEND" (boolean) controls whether the
# wireless remains powered while the laptop is fully suspended
# (i.e., sleeping with a dark screen).  The only reason to set
# this to "yes" is if you want the laptop to forward packets for
# other mesh users while you're not using it.
#
# "config_CPU_IDLE_LIMIT" (integer)  If the cpu is idle less than
# this percentage, then the laptop won't suspend, on the
# assumption that the system is doing something "important" for the
# user.  Set this to 0 to to allow the system to sleep no matter
# how busy the CPU.
#
# "config_SLEEP_WHEN_LID_CLOSED" causes the laptop to go to sleep
# when closed, and is usually desirable.  One might want to turn this
# off if using the laptop as a server, or perhaps when running an
# application which needs to keep running while the laptop is
# transported.  The screen will be turned off in any case, of course.
#
# "config_KEYPRESS_WAKE_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP" says that if the screen
# is blank and the laptop has "idle suspended" (i.e., gone to sleep
# due to inactivity), that a keypress (or touchpad gesture) will wake
# the laptop.  Otherwise this blank-sleeping condition (which is
# visually the same as a power button-induced sleep) will require the
# power button to wake it.  If you like having the keyboard completely
# disabled during any "dark" sleep, then set this to "no".  If the
# power button is used to put the laptop to sleep, this setting will
# have no effect.
#
# "config_WAKE_ON_WLAN" -- determines whether a packet destined for
# your laptop will wake it up from idle suspend, in much the same
# way that a keystroke or mouse movement will wake it up.  see
# also config_WLAN_WAKE_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP.
#
# "config_WLAN_WAKE_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP" controls whether the
# config_WAKE_ON_WLAN setting also applies once the screen has
# blanked.  (The "blanked" state is the final idle state, and usually
# means the laptop simply isn't being used.  Laptops being access
# remotely, however, should probably have this set to "yes".) This
# setting is conditional on enabling keypress wakeups with
# config_KEYPRESS_E_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP.  If the power button is
# used to put the laptop to sleep, this setting will have no effect.
#
#
#####
# Power logging
#
# powerd can optionally perform detailed power usage logging.  powerd
# must be restarted for any changes to the following config_PWRLOG_*
# settings to take effect:
#
# "config_PWRLOG_INTERVAL" determines whether, and how often, logging
# will be performed.  A value of less than 30 seconds will disable
# power logging.  Anything else gives the approximate maximum interval
# between logged samples.  5 minutes (i.e., 300 seconds) is a useful
# setting.  (The value is approximate, because the actual logging
# depends on the granularity of the timer events received from
# olpc-switchd.)
#
# "config_PWRLOG_DIR" is the final destination for the power logs.
# Logs are initially written to /var/log, and copied every 30 minutes
# to the final directory destination.
#
# "config_PWRLOG_LOGSIZE" is the maximum size, in Kbytes, of any single
# log file.  When a log file crosses this threshold, it will be
# copied to $config_PWRLOG_DIR, removed, and a new log started.
#
# "config_PWRLOG_LOGDIRSIZE" is the maximum total space alloted for
# $config_PWRLOG_DIR.  When the directory grows too large, the oldest
# files are removed until the size is below this threshold.
#
#
######
#
# Inhibiting sleep
#
# Idle dim/blank/sleep can be inhibited externally by three separate
# means:
#
# 1) A file may be created in
#     /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/
#   The file must be named after the PID of the process doing the
#   inhibiting (and may be empty).  Stale inhibit files (i.e.,
#   their owner pid no longer exists) will be removed the next time
#   the laptop might sleep.  To manually inhibit dim/blank/sleep one
#   can simply create a file named after a long-running process: 
#   e.g., "touch /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/1".  (Such a file
#   will need to be manually removed, of course.) To assist with the
#   common case of inhibiting suspend while a given program is
#   running, the "olpc-nosleep" wrapper is provided.  e.g.,
#       $ olpc-nosleep wget http://veryslow.downloads.com/bigfile
#
#   The above pid-based flags aren't persistent.  To inhibit suspend
#   in a persistent way (i.e., across reboots), create the file:
#     /etc/powerd/flags/inhibit-suspend
#   (This is the mechanism used by the Sugar control panel UI.)
#
# 2) The modification time of the file
#     /var/run/powerd-inhibit-suspend/.fake_activity
#   will be checked before any sleep occurs, and will be compared to
#   the time of the last "real" user activity.  If it is newer, the
#   dim/blank/sleep will be skipped.  So a program wishing to indicate
#   that it is "active" can simply touch this file periodically to
#   keep it up-to-date.  As a convenience, the command:
#     powerd-config -a
#   will do this touch.  For example, to help keep the laptop alive while
#   an ssh serial console session is in use, add:
#     export PROMPT_COMMAND='powerd-config -a'
#   to your .bash_profile.  This will cause the file to be touched
#   at every shell prompt.
#
# 3) Finally, powerd will try and keep the laptop awake based on
#   various system conditions:  CPU utilizations, network activity, VT
#   console usage, camera and audio usage, and usb device presence. 
#   Network and CPU activity are monitored for 5 seconds before
#   sleep should occur.  These conditions are all checked from the
#   "laptop_busy" function, so look there for details.
#
#   For USB device presence, if the file /etc/powerd/flags/usb-inhibits
#   is present, it will be consulted for matches against USB device
#   id (as hex vend:prod format), just the vendor (as 4 hex
#   characters) or USB device class (as either two byte hex or
#   kernel-reported string.  (i.e., "03" or "hid" will both work to
#   match all HID devices, while "0603:00f2" might match a specific
#   keyboard, and "0603" will match all devices by that vendor.
#
# 4) Idle-suspend will be unconditionally inhibited for 60 seconds
#   after a wakeup from a "dark" (lid or power button) sleep.  In
#   these sleeps, the wlan is powered down, and it sometimes takes
#   some time to reassociate after wakeup.  We don't really want to
#   sleep while the user is waiting for that association to happen.
#
#
# Post-resume scripts can be put in /etc/powerd/postresume.d -- the
# scripts will be run in lexicographic order.  The scripts are run
# detached from powerd, so they won't impede its operation -- however,
# they should be kept as short as possible.
#
#
######
#
# Background discussion:
#
# The inputs that contribute to power management are:
#       power button
#       ebook
#       lid
#       AC plugged/unplugged
#       battery capacity (numeric)
#   Changes on these inputs cause input events on evdev devices
#   /dev/input/eventN.  powerd relies on the companion program
#   "olpc-switchd" to report these events via the /var/run/powerevents
#   fifo it creates for the purpose.  The state of these conditions can
#   also be read from nodes in /sys.  (Some are only available as events
#   on XO-1.)
#
# - Wakeups:
#       rtc wakeup
#       ac_power
#       battery_error
#       battery_soc (i.e., "state of charge" --> capacity)
#       battery_state
#       ebook_mode_change
#       ps2event
#       wlan
#       lid
#   When the system wakes from sleep, /sys/power/wakeup-source
#   reports the cause.
#
# - User activity/idleness:
#   powerd expects user activity and user idle events to be delivered via
#   the olpc-kbdshim daemon. The possible kbdshim events are:
#       useractivity
#       useridle1
#       useridle2
#       useridle3
#
#   These events may be used to dim the screen, blank the screen, and/or
#   put the CPU to sleep, in any order.
#
# - Other system activity: cpu load, network load, etc.
#
#
######
#
# Implementation notes:
#
# - System transitions
#
#   The system can be configured to go through the following 6
#   transition sequences:
#
#       #1      dim     sleep    {blank}  {shutdown}
#       #2      dim     blank    sleep    {shutdown}
#       #3      blank   [dim]    sleep    {shutdown}
#       #4      blank   sleep    {[dim]}  {shutdown}
#       #5      sleep   {blank}  {[dim]}  {shutdown}
#       #6      sleep   {dim}    {blank}  {shutdown}
#
#      {xxx} -- any transition that follows "sleep" is handled in
#           the snooze() function, and not by the useridleN events.
#           That's what the {braces} mean:  "handled by snooze".
#      [dim] -- this state is a no-op, since dimming after blanking
#           doesn't make sense.
#
#   Transitions up through and including "sleep" are driven by the
#   useridle1,2,3 events, and handled by the action routines
#   (dim_action(), blank_action(), and sleep_action()).  These are
#   relatively straightforward.  Once the system is sleeping (using
#   rtcwake), the transitions are handled within the snooze()
#   function.
#
#   As a result of the no-op "[dim]" transition, the
#   implementation of snooze() for sequences #1 and #5 is
#   identical, as is the implementation for #2, #3 and #4.  So
#   snooze() only really has three separate cases to deal with,
#   represented by sequences #2, #1, and #6.  These cases are:
#      - dim then blank then shutdown
#      - blank then shutdown
#      - shutdown
#
#
# - X11
#
#   Note that X11 DPMS is neither consulted nor modified, and it
#   may still blank the display after some period of inactivity.
#   (This won't happen, of course, unless the DPMS "standby" time
#   is shorter than powerd's "sleep" time.)  The effect of DPMS
#   doing this will result in confusion, since when DPMS blanks the
#   screen, powerd can't tell that it's happened.  I.e., a laptop
#   with a screen blanked by DPMS may behave differently than one
#   blanked by powerd.  DPMS should be disabled, either in
#   xorg.conf, or with "xset -dpms".
#
#
# - POSIX shell
#
#   The intention is that powerd be runnable with most any modern
#   shell.  No bash-specific features were used, unless by accident.
#   One possible exception:  in order to implement a non-blocking
#   read of the event fifo, I had to use "read -t 1" (in
#   event_fifo_lookahead()).  Most newer shells implement this, but
#   it's not POSIX.  (The Debian "dash" shell does not, the "ash"
#   shell in busybox works fine.) If run with a shell that doesn't
#   support "-t", the only failure will be the possibility of lost
#   wakeups:  hitting a key just as the system wakes just to dim
#   the screen may not prevent the subsequent sleep.
#
#   Another exception is the (optional) inclusion of olpc-pwr-log.sh,
#   which is heavily dependent on non-POSIX features.
