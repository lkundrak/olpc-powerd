# powerd -- experimental power management for the XO
# 
# this daemon is a more transparent and flexible (if
# incompatible, and perhaps less robust!) replacement for ohmd on
# the XO.  powerd is independent of X, dbus, and hald, and so
# might be attractive to very lightweight software distributions.
#
# in addition to "standard" XO/ohmd functionality, powerd adds:
# -- a power button splash screen (allowing cancel, suspend, or shutdown).
# -- the ability to run arbitrary scripts after a resume.
# -- configurable timeouts until screen dim and sleep, and configurable
#    dim level.
# -- different power management behavior when on wall power vs. battery.
# -- different behavior when in ebook mode (though detection may be unreliable)
# -- ease of customization, given that its written in shell.
#
# unimplemented:
# -- inhibiting idle suspend based on system or network load.
# -- any special support for the mesh, whatsoever.
# -- there's some support for wake-on-lan, but it's not well tested.
# -- probably more.
#
# major config variables are documented in powerd.conf.  powerd reads
# its configuration from /etc/powerd/powerd.conf once at startup,
# and again only when it receives a "reconfig" event on its
# event fifo (/var/run/powerevents).
#
# idle suspend can be manually inhibited by creating the file
#    /var/run/inhibit-idle-suspend
#
# post-resume scripts can be put in /etc/powerd/postresume.d -- the
# scripts will be run in lexicographic order.  the scripts are
# run detached from powerd, so they won't impede its operation -- however,
# they should be kept as short as possible.
#
# the inputs that contribute to power management are:
#
# ** switches:
#       power button
#       ebook
#       lid
# actions on these switches appear as events on
# /dev/input/event[012].  powerd relies on the companion
# program "olpc-switchd" to report these events via the
# /var/run/powerevents fifo it creates for the purpose.  it's
# unfortunate that these events have no corresponding /sys state
# indicators, since knowing the state of the lid, or of ebook
# mode, would be useful in the absence of events (at startup, for
# instance).  in addition, it seems that the ebook switch may
# suffer from the lid switch symptoms described in
# http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/5703 .  the lid switch events seem
# to be reliable (but see below re:  wakeup source reporting).
#
# ** conditions:
#       AC input (boolean)
#       battery level (numeric)
# it's unfortunate that these have no corresponding events, since
# otherwise no polling would be necessary.
#
# ** wakeups:
#       ac_power
#       battery_error
#       battery_soc
#       battery_state
#       ebook_mode_change
#       ps2event
#       wlan
#       lid (or sometimes "empty sci")
# when the system wakes from sleep, /sys/power/wakeup-source reports
# the cause.  lid reporting is not reliable -- sometimes "empty sci"
# is reported instead.  (i've not yet seen a case where "empty sci"
# is reported for lid close, or for ebook_mode_change, but i'm not
# ruling it out.)
#
# ** user activity/idleness:
# powerd expects user activity and user idle events to be delivered via
# the olpc-kbdshim daemon, when invoked with "-A /var/run/powerevents".
# the possible events are:
#       useractivity
#       useridle1
#       useridle2
#       useridle3
#
# these events are used in the following ways:
#
#                  screen          cpu
#                  ------          ---
#     useridle1     dim            on
#     useridle2     dim            sleep
#     rtcwake1      off            sleep
#     rtcwake2           shutdown
#
# or, if $config_DARK_BEFORE_SLEEP is set true, this sequence,
# which is more like a "normal" laptop behaves:
#
#                  screen          cpu
#                  ------          ---
#     useridle1     dim            on
#     useridle2     off            on
#     useridle3     off            sleep
#     rtcwake2           shutdown
#
#
#
# ** other system activity (cpu load, network load, etc):
#       unimplemented
#
# note that X11 DPMS is neither consulted nor configured, and it
# may still be used to blank the display after some period of
# inactivity.  (this won't happen, of course, unless the DPMS
# "standby" time is shorter than powerd's "useridle2" time.
#
# my intention is that this be runnable with most any shell.  no
# bash-specific features were used, unless by accident.
