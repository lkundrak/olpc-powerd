# configuration for powerd.
#
# this file is in /bin/sh syntax, and is read directly by the shell.
# please be careful.

# all four idle times are expressed in seconds: "config_TIME_DIM",
# "config_TIME_SLEEP", "config_TIME_BLANK", "config_TIME_SHUTDOWN".
# dim must happen first.  sleep and blanking can happen in either
# order.  if sleep happens first, the screen will stay on while
# the rest of the system sleeps.  if blanking is scheduled first,
# the screen will go dark while the laptop remains otherwise
# fully active.  in either case, when the screen is dark and
# the laptop is sleeping, it's a "deep" sleep -- keystrokes will
# not wake it up, just as if the power button had been used. 
# shutdown, of course, happens last.

# "config_IDLEDIM" is how dim will the screen go when the first
# timer fires.  (range 0-15.)  if set to 15, the screen will never
# dim.

# normally we try and save power when on battery, but not when on
# external power.  setting "config_SOLAR" (boolean) causes laptop
# to behave as if power were scarce in either case.

# "config_ALWAYSON" (boolean) will suppress any automatic sleeps,
# even on battery.  this overrides "config_SOLAR".  note that
# creating the file /var/run/inhibit-idle-suspend will do much
# the same thing, except that in that case the screen is still
# allowed to dim.

# "config_CONFIRM_SECONDS" determines how long the shutdown/suspend
# confirmation splash screen stays visible before the laptop
# automatically suspends.

# "config_MESH_or_WAKE_ON_WLAN" (boolean) allows wireless to
# continue operating when the laptop is sleeping.  note that the
# wireless configuration may allow shutting down the wireless
# entirely (e.g., with "echo 0>/sys/power/wlan-enabled"), which
# may override this setting.

# "config_USE_EBOOK_PROFILE" (boolean) tells powerd to switch to
# the configuration profile named "ebook" when the laptop is
# folded into ebook mode.
