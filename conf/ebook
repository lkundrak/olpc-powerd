#
# configuration for powerd.
#
# this file is in /bin/sh syntax, and is read directly by the shell.
# please be careful.

# all times are expressed in seconds (though a UI could do whatever
# it wants, of course):
# the idle timers are "config_TIME_DIM", "config_TIME_SLEEP", and
# "config_TIME_BLANK".  dim must happen first.  sleep and
# blanking can happen in either order.  if sleep happens first,
# the screen will stay on while the rest of the system sleeps. 
# if blanking is scheduled first, the screen will go dark while
# the laptop remains otherwise fully active.  in either case,
# when the screen is dark and the laptop is sleeping, it's a
# "deep" sleep -- keystrokes will not wake it up, just as if the
# power button had been used.  shutdown, of course, happens last.
# the maximum time that any sleep will last before the laptop shuts
# down is given by "config_MAX_SLEEP".

# "config_IDLEDIM" is how dim will the screen go when the first
# timer fires.  (range 0-15.)  if set to 15, the screen will never
# dim.

# normally we try and save power when on battery, but not when on
# external power.  setting "config_SOLAR" (boolean) causes laptop
# to behave as if power were scarce in either case.

# "config_ALWAYSON" (boolean) will suppress any automatic sleeps,
# even on battery.  this overrides "config_SOLAR".  note that
# creating the file /var/run/inhibit-idle-suspend will do much
# the same thing, except that in that case the screen is still
# allowed to dim.

# "config_CONFIRM_SECONDS" determines how long the shutdown/suspend
# confirmation splash screen stays visible before the laptop
# automatically suspends.

# "config_MESH_or_WAKE_ON_WLAN" (boolean) allows wireless to
# continue operating when the laptop is sleeping.  note that the
# wireless configuration may allow shutting down the wireless
# entirely (e.g., with "echo 0>/sys/power/wlan-enabled"), which
# may override this setting.

# "config_USE_EBOOK_PROFILE" (boolean) tells powerd to switch to
# the configuration profile named "ebook" when the laptop is
# folded into ebook mode.
