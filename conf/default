#
# configuration for powerd.
#
# this file is in /bin/sh syntax.  please be careful.

# all four idle times are expressed in seconds: "config_TIME_DIM",
# "config_TIME_SLEEP", "config_TIME_BLANK", "config_TIME_SHUTDOWN".
# dim must happen first.  sleep and blanking can happen in either
# order.  if sleep happens first, the screen will stay on while
# the rest of the system sleeps.  if blanking is scheduled first,
# the screen will go dark while the laptop remains otherwise
# fully active.  shutdown, of course, happens last.

# "config_IDLEDIM" is how dim will the screen go when the first
# timer fires.  (range 0-15)

# normally we try and save power when on battery, but not when on
# external power.  setting "config_SOLAR" (boolean) causes laptop to behave
# as if power were scarce in either case.

# "config_ALWAYSON" (boolean) will suppress any automatic sleeps, even on
# battery.  this overrides "config_SOLAR".  note that creating the
# file /var/run/inhibit-idle-suspend will do much the same thing,
# except that in that case the screen is still allowed to dim.

# "config_CONFIRM_SECONDS" determines how long the shutdown/suspend
# confirmation splash screen stays visible before the laptop
# automatically suspends.

# "config_MESH_or_WAKE_ON_WLAN" (boolean) allows wireless to continue
# operating when the laptop is sleeping.  note that the wireless
# configuration may allow shutting down the wireless entirely
# (e.g., with "echo 0>/sys/power/wlan-enabled"), which may
# override this setting.

# "config_USE_EBOOK_PROFILE" (boolean) allows powerd to switch to
# the configuration profile named "ebook" when folded into ebook
# mode.
