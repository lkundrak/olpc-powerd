# Config file for powerd
#
# config_BATTERY_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
# config_EBOOK_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
# config_PLUGGED_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
# These are the time in seconds (measured from last user
# activity) until a) the laptop screen dims, b) the laptop
# sleeps, and c) the laptop screen blanks.  All three can be
# scheduled in any order.  Setting any to '0' suppresses that
# action.
#
# config_MAX_SLEEP_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN
#  Once the laptop sleeps and the screen is blank, it will shut
#  down after this amount of time.  '0' will prevent auto-shutdown.
#
# config_ALLOW_SHUTDOWN_WHEN_PLUGGED
#  If this is disabled, the laptop will never automatically shut
#  down when using external power.  (It may still sleep, however.)
#
# config_INITIAL_BRIGHT_LEVEL
# This sets the the initial brightness of the display, at boot time.
# The range is 0-15.  The backlight consumes 1 watt at full brightness.
#
# config_IDLE_DIM_LEVEL
#  Brightness level when the screen is automatically dimmed.  Set
#  this to 15 to prevent dimming.  Set this to 0 to allow the
#  backlight to go off completely.
#
# config_CONFIRM_SECONDS
#  How long the shutdown/suspend confirmation splash screen stays
#  visible before the laptop automatically suspends.  If this is
#  zero, there will be no splash screen:  the laptop will suspend
#  immediately when the button is pushed.
#
# config_UNFREEZE_SECONDS
#  How long after starting will powerd wait before gratuitously
#  unfreezing the DCON, to activate the display.  Note that under normal
#  circumstances, the display will be unfrozen automatically at the correct
#  time during desktop environment startup, and if the desktop fails to launch,
#  the event.d script will unfreeze the DCON. This can be seen as an emergency
#  fallback for when all else fails.
#
# config_MESH_DURING_SUSPEND  (only on XO-1)
#  This controls whether the wireless remains powered while the
#  laptop is fully suspended (i.e., sleeping with a dark screen).
#  The only reason to set this to "yes" is if you want the laptop
#  to forward packets for other mesh users while you're not using it.
#
# config_WAKE_ON_WLAN
#  Controls whether a packet destined for your laptop will wake it
#  up from idle suspend, in much the same way that a keystroke or
#  mouse movement will wake it up.  Also see the following option:
#
# config_WLAN_WAKE_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP
#  Controls whether the config_WAKE_ON_WLAN setting (above) also
#  applies once the screen has blanked.  Laptops which are
#  regularly accessed remotely should probably set this to "yes",
#  otherwise it saves power to leave it set to "no".
#
# config_KEYPRESS_WAKE_FROM_BLANK_IDLE_SLEEP
#  If the screen is blank and the laptop has suspended due to the
#  user being idle, then setting this to "yes" will let user
#  activity wake the laptop.  Otherwise, being suspended with a
#  blank screen (which is visually the same as a power
#  button-induced sleep) will require the power button to wake. 
#  If you like having the keyboard completely disabled during any
#  "dark" sleep, then set this to "no".
#
#
# config_CPU_IDLE_LIMIT
#  If the cpu is idle less than this percentage, then the laptop
#  won't suspend.
#
# config_SLEEP_WHEN_LID_CLOSED
#  This is normally left enabled, and causes the laptop to go to sleep
#  when closed.  If disabled, it will stay awake when the lid is
#  closed, and will only sleep because of other timeouts.
#
# config_PWRLOG_INTERVAL
# config_PWRLOG_DIR 
# config_PWRLOG_LOGSIZE
# config_PWRLOG_LOGDIRSIZE
#  Refer to the notes in the powerd script itself for descriptions
#  of how these control powerd's optional power logging.
