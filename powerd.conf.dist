# Config file for powerd
#
# config_BATTERY_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
# config_EBOOK_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
# config_PLUGGED_TIME_{DIM,SLEEP,BLANK}
# These are the time in seconds (measured from last user
# activity) until a) the laptop screen dims, b) the laptop
# sleeps, and c) the laptop screen blanks.  All three can be
# scheduled in any order.  Setting any to '0' suppresses that
# action.
#
# config_MAX_SLEEP_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN
#  Once the laptop sleeps and the screen is blank, it will shut
#  down after this amount of time.  '0' will prevent auto-shutdown.
#
# config_ALLOW_SHUTDOWN_WHEN_PLUGGED
#  If this is disabled, the laptop will never automatically shut
#  down when using external power.  (It may still sleep, however.)
#
# config_IDLE_DIM_LEVEL
#  Brightness level when the screen is automatically dimmed.  Set
#  this to 15 to prevent dimming.  Set this to 0 to allow the
#  backlight to go off completely.
#
# config_CONFIRM_SECONDS
#  How long the shutdown/suspend confirmation splash screen stays
#  visible before the laptop automatically suspends.  If this is
#  zero, there will be no splash screen:  the laptop will suspend
#  immediately when the button is pushed.
#
# config_UNFREEZE_SECONDS
#  How long after starting will powerd wait before gratuitously
#  unfreezing the DCON, to activate the display.  This allows most
#  of the intermediate stages of boot screens to be hidden until
#  the window manager is ready.
#
# config_MESH_DURING_SUSPEND  (only on XO-1)
#  This controls whether the wireless remains powered while the
#  laptop is fully suspended (i.e., sleeping with a dark screen).
#  The only reason to set this to "yes" is if you want the laptop
#  to forward packets for other mesh users while you're not using it.
#
# config_WAKE_ON_WLAN
#  Controls whether a packet destined for your laptop will wake it
#  up from idle suspend, in much the same way that a keystroke or
#  mouse movement will wake it up.
#
# config_CPU_IDLE_LIMIT
#  If the cpu is idle less than this percentage, then the laptop
#  won't suspend.
#
# config_SLEEP_WHEN_LID_CLOSED
#  This is normally left enabled, and causes the laptop to go to sleep
#  when closed.  If disabled, it will stay awake when the lid is
#  closed, and will only sleep because of other timeouts.
#
# config_PWRLOG_INTERVAL
# config_PWRLOG_DIR 
# config_PWRLOG_LOGSIZE
# config_PWRLOG_LOGDIRSIZE
#  Refer to the notes in the powerd script itself for descriptions
#  of how these control powerd's optional power logging.
